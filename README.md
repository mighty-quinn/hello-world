# hello-world
just another repository

Mighty-Quinn here! I plan to use github to develop various small(ish) games to add to a portfolio, and to develop applications that are useful for my current career track. Mostly, I want to improve my software development skills enough for them to be marketable. If my willpower shifts, I might also make use of github to help me write a novel of some sort, but that's pretty unlikely.
